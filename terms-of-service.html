<h2 id="definitions" class="h4">Definitions.</h2>
<p><u>"Blockchain"</u>: A blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent manner. It uses cryptography
to ensure that records cannot be altered or deleted once they have been added to the ledger. Consensus mechanisms, such as proof-of-work or
proof-of-stake, are used to ensure that all participants in the network agree on the same version of the ledger that a blockchain entails.</p>
<p><u>"Blockchain Consensus Mechanisms"</u>: Consensus mechanisms are the processes by which a distributed network of nodes or participants come to an
agreement on the state of the network and the transactions that have occurred within it. In a blockchain network, a consensus mechanism is used to
validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. Consensus mechanisms also ensure that all participants in the network agree on the same
version of the truth, and prevent double-spending, fraud, and other attacks on the network. The choice of consensus mechanism can have a significant
impact on the security, scalability, and decentralization of the network. There are several different types of consensus mechanisms, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Proof of Work (PoW): This mechanism requires participants, known as miners, to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and add
new blocks to the blockchain. The first miner to solve the puzzle receives a reward in the form of newly minted cryptocurrency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of Stake (PoS): In this mechanism, validators are selected to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain based on the amount
of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to "stake" or lock up as collateral. Validators are incentivized to act honestly as they risk losing
their stake if they validate fraudulent transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional Mechanisms include Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), and
others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each consensus mechanism has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which a platform or protocol may use depends on the specific needs and
goals of the specific network.</p>
<p><u>Layer-1 ("L1") and Layer-2 ("L2") blockchain technology.</u> In the context of blockchains, Layer-1 and Layer-2 refer to different levels of blockchain
technology that work together to enable various functionalities and applications. Further:</p>
<ul>
<li>Layer-1 refers to the base layer or the underlying protocol of a blockchain. This layer contains the core features and functionalities of the
blockchain, such as consensus mechanisms, block creation, transaction validation, and network security. Bitcoin and Ethereum are examples of Layer-1
blockchains; and</li>
<li>Layer-2, on the other hand, refers to additional layers built on top of the Layer-1 blockchain to provide additional functionalities and
scalability. These layers use the underlying Layer-1 blockchain for security and decentralization but enable additional features such as off-chain
transactions, smart contracts, and more. Layer-2 solutions include Lightning Network for Bitcoin and various scaling solutions for Ethereum, such as
state channels and Plasma.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Layer-1 provides the base level of functionality and security for a blockchain, while Layer-2 adds additional features and scalability to
enable a wider range of use cases and applications.</p>
<u>Blockchains employed by the CyberKongz Ecosystem</u>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Ethereum" (or "ETH"): Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain network that enables the creation and execution of programmable "smart contracts" and
decentralized applications. Ethereum originally operated on a proof-of-work consensus mechanism but has transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus
mechanism. Ethereum allows for the creation of dApps that can operate without the need for intermediaries, providing greater efficiency, security,
and transparency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Polygon" (or "Matic"): Polygon is a blockchain network that enables developers to create decentralized applications or "dApps" generally
characterized by high-speed transactions and lower costs (as compared to Ethereum mainnet). Polygon is considered a Layer-2 scaling solution for
Ethereum; It achieves this by using sidechains, which are separate blockchains that can communicate with the Ethereum mainnet. Users of Polygon may
need to interact with the network and/or its token, MATIC, to use certain features or services on the website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Important Note: Blockchains such as Ethereum and Polygon are public, open, transparent, and searchable blockchains. And:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<u><p>By using CyberKongzÂ® you acknowledge that your NFTs and related addresses will be stored on publicly searchable blockchains. CyberKongz and third
parties have no power to delete this data. You release and indemnify CyberKongz LLC from any liability associated with data that you publish to
public blockchains by using our platform. If you conduct any transaction on our platform involving public blockchains, you are effectively
publishing that information and assume full responsibility for doing so.</p></u>
<br>
<u>Ethereum "ERC" Token Standards.</u>
<br>
<br>
<p><u>"ERC"</u>: ERC stands for "Ethereum Request for Comments", and is a set of technical standards used for creating tokens on the Ethereum
blockchain. These standards define the rules and functions that must be implemented by smart contracts to enable the creation, transfer, and
management of tokens on the Ethereum network. ERC token standards also provide a common framework for developers to create and interact with tokens
on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring interoperability and compatibility between different tokens and applications.</p>
<p>The most well-known ERC standards are ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, and ERC-998, which have been widely adopted by the Ethereum community for creating
fungible, non-fungible, semi-fungible, and composable tokens.</p>
<p>CyberKongzÂ® ecosystem may involve various ERC token standards, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>ERC-20: A technical specification for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It defines the functions and events that smart contracts must
implement to enable token transfers and management.</li>
<li>ERC-721: A technical specification for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables unique digital assets, such as
collectibles, to be tokenized and traded on the blockchain.</li>
<li>ERC-1155: A technical specification for semi-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables multiple instances of a token to be created with
varying attributes or values, allowing for greater flexibility in token creation.</li>
<li>ERC-998: A technical specification for composable tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables tokens to be combined and split apart, creating new
tokens with unique properties and capabilities.Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are two consensus mechanisms used by blockchain networks
to validate transactions and secure the network.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>"CyberKongzÂ® Ecosystem"</u>: The CyberKongzÂ® Ecosystem is a collection of 5,000 randomly generated 2D avatars and 15,000 randomly generated 3D
avatars or NFTs, collectively referred to as CyberKongzÂ®. The CyberKongzÂ® project refers to the collection of digital artworks featuring gorillas with
distinct personalities and features, as well as the associated platform, services, and intellectual property owned by the CyberKongzÂ® team.
CyberKongzÂ® NFT refers to any individual art, design, 2D drawing, or 3D model associated with a CyberKongzÂ® NFT that you own in your Ethereum wallet,
with proof of ownership recorded on the blockchain. These NFTs have unique, individually layered art files and traits that contribute to their overall
value. To own a CyberKongzÂ® NFT means to possess it in your Ethereum wallet, with proof of ownership recorded on the blockchain.</p>
<p><u>"NFT"</u>: The acronym NFT refers to non-fungible tokens, which are unique digital assets created and stored on a blockchain network. It cannot be
exchanged for an equal asset and has specific rights for its holder to use and transfer the digital data associated with it, subject to any
intellectual property rights that may attach to the data via the platform or smart contracts used to create and govern the NFT. NFTs are often used
with other technologies that affect their use and the rights attached to them. Smart Contracts refers to self-executing contracts with the terms of
the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code that execute on the blockchain. The ERC-721 standard and ERC-1155
standard refer to the technical standards used for non-fungible tokens and fungible and non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, respectively.</p>
<p><u>"CyberKongz VX"</u>: CyberKongz VX refers specifically to the collection of 15,000 3D avatars designed for use in the metaverse and beyond, with
traits unique to each NFT that contribute to their overall value. Traits refer to the distinguishing characteristics of CyberKongzÂ® NFTs, including
but not limited to eyes, eyewear, mouths, headwear, body, clothing, background, accessories, wearables, and equipment for CyberKongz VX. These traits
are unique to each CyberKongzÂ® NFT and contribute to their overall value</p>
<p><u>"Play & Kollect (P&K)"</u>: Play & Kollect (or "P&K") refers to the distributed application developed on the Ethereum and/or Polygon networks that
allows users to manage and control unique non-fungible collectible tokens developed on the ERC-721 standard ("CyberKongz VX"), as well as interact
with other users in the CyberKongzÂ® ecosystem and manage secondary child tokens based on the ERC-1155 standard (wearables). P&K Dapp refers to the
Play & Kollect distributed application, which is visualized on a website that users can interact with.</p>
<p><u>"Adventure Run"</u>: Built as part of the Play & Kollect ecosystem, Adventure Run is a fully on-chain game with levels, experience, NFT's as prizes
and events which can be triggered by specific conditions and verified via Chainlink VRF.</p>
<p><u>"Chainlink VRF" ("CVRF")</u>: CVRF is a decentralized and verifiable random number generation system designed to provide secure and unbiased
randomness for use in various applications, such as online gaming and other cryptographic systems. It works by leveraging a network of independent
nodes that collectively generate and verify random numbers, making it virtually impossible for any single node to manipulate the outcome. Based on
advanced cryptographic techniques, CVRF is widely considered to be a reliable and tamper-proof solution.</p>

<p><u>"Banana Token"</u>: The Banana Token (or "$BANANA") is a utility token used within the CyberKongzÂ® ecosystem,which has no monetary value within the
CyberKongzÂ® ecosystem and which cannot be redeemed for cash. It may be used, however, for various utility-related purposes within the ecosystem, such
as participating in events and accessing exclusive content..</p>
<p><u>"Commercial use"</u>: Commercial use refers to any use of CyberKongzÂ® NFTs or intellectual property for the purpose of making a profit or
generating revenue. Derivative use refers to any use of CyberKongzÂ® NFTs or intellectual property to create new works or products that are based on or
inspired by the original CyberKongzÂ® artwork. Ownership refers to the legal rights that arise from possessing an NFT, including the right to use,
display, and sell the NFT for personal and non-commercial purposes.</p>
<p><u>"Intellectual Property"</u>: Intellectual Property (of "IP") refers to the legal rights that arise from intellectual creativity in the industrial,
scientific, literary and artistic fields. Users, recipients, and potential buyers of NFTs should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence
to ensure that the NFTs and the platforms, protocols, laws, regulations, jurisdictions, restrictions, intellectual property, usage and transfer
limitations, associated fees, and other legal, regulatory, and financial aspects of NFTs are genuine and compliant with their expectations and
requirements. Professional legal guidance may be advised for individuals engaging with NFTs and other digital assets.</p>
<p><u>"CyberKongzÂ®"</u>: The term "CyberKongzÂ®" also includes CyberKongzÂ® games like "Play & Kollect," CyberKongzÂ® utility tokens like the "Banana"
token, CyberKongzÂ® products, merch, and official partnerships, inter alia. The community refers to the group of individuals who share a passion for
the CyberKongzÂ® universe and participate in the platform and associated activities.</p>
<p><u>"Rig/Image/Model"</u>: Rig/Image/Model refers to individual FBX, VXR, VXA, VXM, VOX, GLTF, GLB, OBJ models, PNG, GIF, and JPEG files, as well as
all underlying files containing proprietary CyberKongzÂ® traits. These files are used to create and customize CyberKongzÂ® NFTs, and are subject to
intellectual property rights and ownership.</p>
<p><u>"Bridging" between blockchains</u>: "Bridging" between blockchains refers to the process of establishing a connection between two separate
blockchains to enable the transfer of assets or data from one blockchain to another. This can be done through the use of specialized software
protocols or intermediary networks that facilitate the exchange.</p>
<u>Potential risks involved in using a blockchain bridge depend on the specific implementation and design of the bridge, and may include:</u>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Security Risks: If the bridge protocol is not well-designed or implemented, it may be vulnerable to attacks, such as hacking or theft of assets or
funds, and weakness in the security of the bridge may be exploited by bots and/or hackers;</li>
<li>Liquidity Risks: In some cases, there may be low liquidity on one or both sides of the bridge, which can lead to difficulties in exchanging assets.
In the context of swap or exchange, this results in price fluctuations and may make it difficult for users to execute transactions;</li>
<li>Counterparty Risks: If the bridge involves a centralized exchange or intermediary, users may be exposed to counterparty risks. This means that if
the platform, or intermediary goes bankrupt or becomes insolvent, users may lose their assets or, in the event funds or valuable assets are
involved, the value of those funds and or assets may be lost;</li>
<li>Smart Contract Risks: Bridges that use smart contracts to facilitate the exchange of assets or data may be vulnerable to bugs or programming errors.
These errors can lead to unintended consequences, such as the loss of assets or funds or the unintended transfer thereof;</li>
<li>Regulatory Risks: Bridging between blockchains may involve the exchange of assets that are subject to different regulatory frameworks. This can
create legal and compliance risks for users, especially if the exchange is not authorized or regulated by relevant authorities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, bridging between blockchains can offer significant benefits to users, such as increased liquidity and access to a wider range of assets.
However, it is important for users to understand the risks involved and to carefully consider the design and implementation of the bridge before using
it.</p>
<p><u>Bridging within the CyberKongzÂ® Ecosystem</u>: One specific example of bridging between blockchains is bringing Ethereum mainnet utility tokens to
Polygon for gaming purposes on the CyberKongzÂ® website. This bridging process can enable users to use their Ethereum-based utility tokens to
participate in gaming activities on the CyberKongzÂ® website, which is hosted on the Polygon network. Since CyberKongzÂ® website does not permit users
to buy or sell tokens, nor employs fiat on or offramps, the loss of funds is unlikely. Nevertheless the loss of in-game assets and/or issues
pertaining to transfer, and other losses may occur. Thus, it is important for users to carefully consider risks before participating in any bridging
activity and to take appropriate precautions, such as using reputable bridging protocols and conducting thorough due diligence on any counterparties
involved.</p>
<u>Some of the benefits of bridging within the CyberKongzÂ® Ecosystem include:</u>
<ul>
<li>Increased Accessibility: By bringing Ethereum-based utility tokens to Polygon, users can access CyberKongzÂ® gaming ecosystem, as well as those
existing on the Polygon network, which offers faster and cheaper transactions compared to the Ethereum mainnet;</li>
<li>Improved Gaming Experience: Users can use their familiar Ethereum-based utility tokens to participate in gaming activities on the CyberKongzÂ®
website, making the gaming experience more seamless and convenient;</li>
<li>Lower Transaction Fees: By using the Polygon network for gaming purposes, users can take advantage of lower transaction fees compared to the
Ethereum mainnet, which can make it more cost-effective to participate in gaming activities.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Network Fees</u>: Network Fees are charges incurred by users for performing transactions or executing smart contracts on a blockchain network, paid
to validators or miners as compensation for processing and validating the transactions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethereum (PoS) network fees: Determined by the gas limit and base fee of a transaction, after the successful Merge from Proof of Work to Proof of
Stake consensus algorithm on September 15, 2022. The base fee is algorithmically adjusted based on network demand and is burned, not paid to
validators. Additional tips may be paid by the user to incentivize miners to prioritize their transaction;</li>
<li>Polygon network fees: Denominated in MATIC and significantly lower than Ethereum's due to its PoS consensus algorithm and off-chain scaling
solutions. Average transaction fees range from a fraction of a cent to a few dollars depending on the complexity and urgency of the transaction.</li>
